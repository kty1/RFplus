# RFplus


RF+ is a prototype program for computing RF(+) distances between phylogenetic trees. RF(+) distance is designed to more meaningfully compute the Robinson-Foulds distance between two trees that only have a partially overlapping leaf set. The traditional approach for computing Robinson-Foulds distance between two trees that only have a partially overlapping leaf set is to first restrict the two trees to their shared leaf set and then compute their Robinson-Foulds distance. We refer to distances computed in this way as RF(-) distances.  In contrast, the RF(+) distance between two arbitrary trees is computed by first optimally completing each tree on the union of the leaf sets of both trees so as to minimize the Robinson-Foulds distance between them, and then reporting the Robinson-Foulds distance between the two completed trees.
